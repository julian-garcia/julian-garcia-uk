# julian-garcia.uk
This is my personal website, built using Django, basically my online CV/Resume and a showcase for projects and previous development work. Also to highlight my ongoing and future development and my current coding activity.

## Technical approach
The site was developed using web framework **Django** alongside **Python**, using its Model-View-Template structure. The coding activity chart is visualised using the **Wakatime** API alongside JavaScript library **Chart.js**. Dynamic front end elements were implemented using vanilla **JavaScript**. For device responsiveness a mixture of pure CSS and the CSS only library **Bulma** are employed.

## Typography
Google Fonts: "Asap" (major headings), "Kalam" (sub headings and buttons), "Markazi Text" (body text).
